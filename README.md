# Waze-Project-Regression-Analysis

Regression analysis: Simplify complex data relationships

Your team is more than halfway through their user churn project. Earlier, you completed a project proposal, used Python to explore and analyze Wazeâ€™s user data, created data visualizations, and conducted a hypothesis test. Now, leadership wants your team to build a regression model to predict user churn based on a variety of variables.

You check your inbox and discover a new email from Ursula Sayo, Waze's Operations Manager. Ursula asks your team about the details of the regression model. You also notice two follow-up emails from your supervisor, May Santner. The first email is a response to Ursula, and says that the team will build a binomial logistic regression model. In her second email, May asks you to help build the model and prepare an executive summary to share your results.

A notebook was structured and prepared to help you in this project. Please complete the following questions and prepare an executive summary.

#### Course 5 End-of-course project: Regression modeling
In this activity, you will build a binomial logistic regression model. As you have learned, logistic regression helps you estimate the probability of an outcome. For data science professionals, this is a useful skill because it allows you to consider more than one variable against the variable you're measuring against. This opens the door for much more thorough and flexible analysis to be completed.

**The purpose** of this project is to demostrate knowledge of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and a binomial logistic regression model.

**The goal** is to build a binomial logistic regression model and evaluate the model's performance.

This activity has three parts:

**Part 1**: EDA & Checking Model Assumptions

* What are some purposes of EDA before constructing a binomial logistic regression model?
**Part 2**: Model Building and Evaluation

* What resources do you find yourself using as you complete this stage?
**Part 3**: Interpreting Model Results

* What key insights emerged from your model(s)?

* What business recommendations do you propose based on the models built?



Follow the instructions and answer the question below to complete the activity. Then, you will complete an executive summary using the questions listed on the PACE Strategy Document.

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work.
